About pkgcreator
================

pkgcreator is a command line tool for operating systems based on 
Debian GNU/Linux with the goal of automating some of the tasks of 
packaging binaries. The idea behind the tool is to be able to do all 
the necessary steps of creating the package based on information 
retrieved from a single markup file . This file uses the YAML as its 
markup language, which provides good readability for human beings yet 
being able to represent almost any structured information. By 
processing this file, pkgcreator can generate menus entries, icons 
and Debian specific files automatically.

Installing
==========

== Pre-requisites ==

The following packages must be installed before trying to install 
pkgcreator:

    python-imaging: used to generate icons
    python-yaml: used to parse package markup files
    dpkg: used to generate the final package
    kwalify: used to verify if the package markup file is valid 
			 (optional, but highly recommended)

All these packages are available in recent versions of Ubuntu and 
Debian.

Also, if the Python package colorama is installed and the terminal 
supports colors, pretty messages will be displayed. The colorama 
package can be downloaded from the project's page
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama).

Debian package from the project's page and double-click it.
