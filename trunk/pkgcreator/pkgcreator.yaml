  short_description: Creates Debian binary packages
  long_description: |
    This tool features a .deb package generator that makes the creation
    of menus, icons, DEBIAN control file and others easier, by using one simple
    yaml file.
    
    It's a work in progress and currently not all the options and rules of the 
    Debian package system are available.
